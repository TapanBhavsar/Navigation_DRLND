# Navigation_DRLND
  Navigation project of UDACITY's Deep Reinforcement learning NanoDegree

## Requirement

1. Python version: **python3**.
2. Install **Jupyter notebook**.
> 1. Numpy (pip3 install numpy)
> 2. matplotlib (pip3 install matplotlib)
> 3. pytorch (pip3 install torch torchvision)

## Description:

[Environment](https://github.com/TapanBhavsar/Navigation_DRLND/tree/master/python) has been provided in project 1 by Udacity. 37 states and 4 actions havew been fetched from given environment and fed to agent explain in [Navigation.ipynb](https://github.com/TapanBhavsar/Navigation_DRLND/blob/master/Navigation.ipynb) 

Run first three cell in [notebook](https://github.com/TapanBhavsar/Navigation_DRLND/blob/master/Navigation.ipynb) to load Environment. 
> **DO NOT RUN CELL NO 6**
```
env.close()
```

After that run all following cells to train and get graph of average reward over the training to see If the Training is right or not.
